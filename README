PPRNG 1.2.0

Mac Requirements: Intel Mac with OS X 10.5 or greater.

DS Requirements: DS or DS Lite. If you have DSi / XL / 3DS, only C-Gear is
supported at this time. Researchers are working hard to figure this out, but
it's not a simple task.



Quick Start:
1. First, before doing anything else, open the DS / Game Config screen.
2. Enter what you know about your game and DS (at minimum, that would be game
   version and MAC address).
3. Click OK to save the config.
4. If you don't know your DS Parameters, go to the DS Parameter Searcher to find
   your parameters.  Once you have found your parameters, go back to the
   DS / Game Config screen and add them to your configuration.
5. You are now ready to search for Standard Seeds in the Standard Seed Searcher.

General Usage Tip:
In any seed searcher window (Standard Seed, Wonder Card, C-Gear), double click
on a result row to bring up the seed inspector for that specific seed.


New in 1.2.0
* Initial Egg Seed Searcher added.  It isn't always accurate when calculating
  how many expected results there will be, but it shouldn't prevent you from
  running reasonable searches.  In some cases you can run searches that will
  return way too many results.
* Added Characteristic to the Adjacents Tab of the Standard Seed Inspector.
* Updated wild encounter PID generation to use the newest researched algorithm.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't have an ID or SID of 0 (again).
* Fixed a bug where the searches would get stuck if there were too few seeds
  being considered (most commonly seen in the ID Frame Search tab).
* Various minor cosmetic changes.  Most notable is that shiny is now indicated
  with a star instead of '!!!' (because I felt like it).

Known Issues in this version:

* None of the 'Find' or 'Save' buttons in the seed inspectors work. For now,
  you'll just have to scroll through manually. 'Save' buttons in the searcher
  windows should properly save CSV files of the results.
* Copy / Paste will work on specific fields that you can type in, but at the
  moment you can't copy other things such as result rows.
* There is not much in the way of argument checking. If you set a minimum IV
  that is greater than the corresponding maximum IV, it will try very hard to
  find that impossible IV spread.
* There is some funny behavior when editing the DS / Game Config with multiple
  windows open. The selected config in other windows appears to change. It is a
  minor annoyance, but for now just set your config again in the other window
  from it's drop down menu. Down the line there will be a bit of an interface
  change to deal with this.

Upcoming Features:

* More info related to shiny frames in the Standard Seed Searcher.
* Perhaps a Seed Inspector specifically for Eggs.
* Generation 4 Support - Seed Inspection, time permitting.

Previous Releases:

1.1.5
* Added Characteristic calculation for egg frames if you supply the IV frame
  number and the IVs of both parents.  This is helpful for locating which frame
  you landed on.
* Fixed (hopefully) incorrect egg frame generation.
* Removed the ES (everstone) column from the egg tab of the Standard Seed
  Inspector.  If breeding with an everstone, the nature will be replaced with
  <ES> if the everstone takes effect.
* Added columns for held item, fishing success, and dust/shadow item to the
  PID frame section of the Standard Seed Searcher.
* Added a switch for when the first pokemon in your party has the ability
  Compound Eyes to the PID frame section of the Standard Seed Inspector. This
  has a small effect on how the frame is generated, but most importantly it has
  an effect on the item that a wild Pokemon holds (if it holds any at all).
* Added columns for fishing success and dust/shadow encounter to the Trainer ID
  searcher so that you can know whether your shiny PID will allow you to fish
  and / or find a Pokemon in swirling dust / bridge shadows.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't have an ID / SID of 0.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't type into the Hidden Power minimum power field.

1.1.0:
* ID/SID Abuse - See Trainer ID Searcher
* DS Parameter Searcher now uses the MAC address from your configuration.
* Min PID frame for shiny search in Standard Seed Searcher
* Better estimation of the number of results (now considers HP type, shininess)

1.0.5:
* Added Stationary Encounter frame type to cover encounters such as Coballion.
* Various minor GUI fixes.

1.0.4
* Bugfix for incorrect Encounter Slot calculation.
* Added Sync and ESV columns to shiny section of the Standard Seed Searcher.

1.0.3
Fixed a bug causing the Standard Seed Searcher to not display shiny PID frame
information.

1.0.2
Actual fix for OS X 10.5 issues.

1.0.1
Attempt to fix issues when running on OS X 10.5.

1.0.0
